# Domain Description: Inventory Management System

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for an Inventory Management System (IMS) designed for a retail or warehouse setting. The primary goal of the system is to provide accurate and real-time tracking of products throughout their lifecycle within the business.

## Core Requirements

The system must effectively manage inventory by:

1.  **Tracking Products:** Maintain detailed records of all products, including their current quantities, physical locations (e.g., specific warehouse, store section), and status (e.g., available in stock, out of stock, currently in transit).
2.  **Inventory Updates:** Allow authorized users to record the receipt of new inventory shipments from suppliers and automatically or manually update stock levels when items are sold, transferred, or adjusted.
3.  **Reordering Management:** Support processes for reordering products, potentially based on predefined minimum stock levels (reorder points) or sales data, to prevent stockouts.
4.  **Product Identification:** Incorporate methods for easy product identification, such as support for barcode scanning.
5.  **Supplier Integration:** Manage information about suppliers and potentially integrate with them for streamlined ordering or information exchange.
6.  **Reporting:** Generate reports to provide insights into inventory status, such as stock levels, inventory turnover rates, demand patterns, and alerts for items running low on stock.

## Key Features and Considerations

*   **Scalability:** The system must be designed to handle a potentially large and growing number of products, transactions, and storage locations.
*   **Multi-Location Support:** The IMS should be capable of managing inventory across multiple physical locations (e.g., different warehouses, retail stores).
*   **Inventory Types:** It should accommodate various types of inventory, such as raw materials, finished goods, and consumable supplies.
*   **User Roles:** Different users (e.g., warehouse staff, managers, purchasing agents) may require different levels of access and permissions.
*   **Accuracy:** Maintaining accurate inventory counts is crucial for business operations. The system should facilitate processes like stock audits or cycle counts.

## Advanced Capabilities (Potential Future Considerations)

*   Integration with Point-of-Sale (POS) systems for real-time sales data updates.
*   Automated replenishment suggestions or purchase order generation.
*   Demand forecasting based on historical data.
*   Tracking inventory value and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).

The overall aim is to create a robust and user-friendly system that improves efficiency, reduces errors, minimizes holding costs, and ensures product availability across the supply chain.
