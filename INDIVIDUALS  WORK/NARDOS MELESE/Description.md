DOMAIN 7:VEHICLE RENTAL SYSTEM

project Description:Vehicle Rental System

The Vehicle Rental System is an object-oriented application developed to manage
and automate the process of renting vehicles. It is designed for rental companies that offer a variety of vehicles such as cars, bikes, and vans to customers for a specified period.

This system allows customers to register, browse available vehicles, make reservations, and complete rental transactions. It also provides a management interface for administrators to handle vehicle inventory, update rental rates, monitor reservations, and maintain service records.

Key modules include:

Vehicle Management: Tracks details like model, availability, and rental rates.

Reservation System: Allows users to book vehicles for specific dates.

Rental Transactions: Handles rental processing and generates invoices.

Payment Processing: Supports recording and managing payments.

Maintenance Tracking: Keeps logs of vehicle service history.

Admin Panel: Provides tools to manage fleet and monitor system activity.


This project applies fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to ensure a modular, reusable, and scalable architecture.

The final system aims to improve efficiency, reduce manual errors, and enhance customer satisfaction by providing a user-friendly, reliable rental experience.
