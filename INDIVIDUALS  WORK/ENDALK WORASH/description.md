# Domain Description: Hotel Reservation System

This project requires designing a Hotel Reservation System. The system should allow customers to search for hotels, view available rooms, make bookings, and manage their reservations. It needs to handle dynamic aspects like real-time room availability and variable pricing strategies.

## Key Functionalities Required

1.  **Hotel & Room Search:** Customers must be able to search for hotels based on criteria like location, price, room type, and amenities.
•	Allow users to search for hotels based on:

-Location                     -Room type

-Date range                   -Amenities

-Price range                 -Availability

•	Apply filters and sorting to refine search results.

2.  **Booking Management:** The system must process room bookings, including selecting dates, room types, and confirming reservations.
3.  **Reservation Management:** Customers should be able to view, modify, or cancel their existing bookings according to defined rules.
• iew existing bookings.

•	Modify booking details (e.g., dates, room selection).

•	Cancel reservations and process refunds (if applicable).

4.  **Availability Tracking:** The system must maintain accurate, real-time information about which rooms are available for specific dates.
5.  **Pricing Management:** Handle different pricing models (fixed, dynamic based on season/occupancy) and potentially apply discounts or promotions.
6.  **Customer Profiles:** Manage customer information, potentially including preferences and loyalty program status.
7.  **Payment Processing:** Integrate secure payment handling for bookings.
8.  **External Integrations (Optional):** Consider how the system might connect with related services like car rentals or tour bookings.

## System Characteristics

*   **Scalability:** The system needs to handle variations in demand, seasonal changes, and potentially support multiple hotel chains or locations.
*   **Data Security:** Customer information and payment details must be handled securely.
*   **User Experience:** Provide a seamless and intuitive interface for customers making reservations.

*   Okay, here is the Initial Object Identification Table for the Hotel Reservation System domain, formatted with columns for Type, Visibility, and Rationale/Responsibility.
