# DOMAIN 2:E-LEARNING SYSTEM
This project involves designing an online E-Learning System. The goal is to create a platform where instructors can create and manage online courses, and students can enroll, learn, and track their progress.
An e-learning system is designed to facilitate learning and teaching through digital platforms. It allows students, educators, and institutions to access educational content, collaborate remotely, and streamline the learning process. Below is a detailed description of the system, including the problem it addresses, solutions, and the main entities involved.
Okay, here is an Initial Object Identification Table based on the E-Learning System domain description and case study. This table lists potential objects (which often become classes) identified early in the modeling process.

# Domain Description: E-Learning System

## Case Study Overview

This project involves designing an online E-Learning System. The goal is to create a platform where instructors can create and manage online courses, and students can enroll, learn, and track their progress.

## Key Functionalities Required

1.  User Management: Support different user roles, primarily Students and Instructors. Users need to register and log in.
2.  Course Creation & Management: Instructors must be able to create courses, organize content within them (e.g., into modules and lessons), and upload various learning materials.
3.  Content Delivery: The system must handle different types of content like videos, text readings (like PDFs), and interactive elements like quizzes.
4.  Student Enrollment: Students should be able to browse available courses and enroll in them.
5.  Progress Tracking: The system needs to track student progress through courses, including completed lessons and quiz scores.
6.  Assessment: Support for creating and taking quizzes or other assessments is required, along with managing grades.
7.  Interaction: Facilitate basic interaction, possibly through discussion forums or messaging between students and instructors (though advanced features like live sessions might be secondary).
8.  User Interface Considerations: While not modeling the UI itself, the design should support a user-friendly experience for both learners and instructors.

# System Characteristics

*   Scalability: The system should be capable of handling a growing number of users (students and instructors), courses, and content materials.
*   Data Privacy & Security: Protecting user information (personal details, grades) is critical.
*   Content Variety: The design must accommodate different formats of learning materials.
*   Accessibility (Optional): Consider if features like offline access might be needed.

  Okay, here is the Initial Object Identification Table for the E-Learning System, formatted with columns for Type, Visibility (representing typical intended class access), and Rationale/Responsibility.

**Initial Object Identification Table: E-Learning System**

| Object/Class Name       | Type  | Visibility | Rationale / Responsibility                                                                         |
| :---------------------- | :---- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**                | Class | `public`   | Represents any individual using the system; base for roles; handles login and profile details.     |
| **Student**             | Class | `public`   | A specific `User` who enrolls in courses, views content, takes assessments, and tracks progress.     |
| **Instructor**          | Class | `public`   | A specific `User` who creates courses, adds content, manages lessons, and potentially grades students. |
| **Course**              | Class | `public`   | The main container for learning content on a specific subject; manages modules and student enrollment. |
| **Module**              | Class | `public`   | Organizes `Lesson` objects within a `Course` into logical sections (e.g., units, chapters).         |
| **Lesson**              | Class | `public`   | Represents a single learning unit containing specific `ContentItem`s (like videos, readings).        |
| **ContentItem**         | Class | `public`   | A general concept for any piece of learning material; acts as a base for specific content types.   |
| **Video**               | Class | `public`   | A type of `ContentItem` specifically for delivering video-based learning material.                 |
| **Reading / Document**  | Class | `public`   | A type of `ContentItem` for text-based materials like articles or PDF documents.                 |
| **Quiz / Assessment**   | Class | `public`   | A type of `ContentItem` designed to test student understanding through questions.                |
| **Enrollment**          | Class | `public`   | Tracks the specific relationship between one `Student` and one `Course`, including status data.    |
| **Grade / Score**       | Class | `public`   | Represents the outcome of an `Assessment`; could also be an attribute within `Enrollment` or `Student`. |
| **Progress Record**     | Class | `public`   | Tracks a `Student`'s completion status within a `Course` or `Lesson`; may be part of `Enrollment`. |
| **Discussion Forum**    | Class | `public`   | Provides a space linked to a `Course` for users (students/instructors) to interact via posts.    |
| **Post / Message**      | Class | `public`   | Represents an individual message or comment within a `Discussion Forum`.                           |
| **ElearningPlatform / Manager** | Class | `public` | (Potential Controller) Manages the overall interactions and workflows between core objects.     |
